# During-Work Progress Tracking

## Active Work Guidelines

### 1. Reference Plan for Decisions
- Consult plan when making architectural choices
- Ensure decisions align with project direction
- Consider impact on future milestones

### 2. Discovery Tracking
Note any discoveries that affect:
- Future milestone planning
- Technical dependencies
- Scope or complexity estimates
- Architecture decisions

### 3. Progress Monitoring
Track progress on current milestone items:
- Which tasks are being worked on
- Estimated completion status
- Any blockers encountered
- Changes in approach or scope

### 4. Decision Documentation
Log significant decisions made during work:
- Technical approach choices
- Architecture modifications
- Scope adjustments
- Dependency discoveries

## Real-Time Updates
