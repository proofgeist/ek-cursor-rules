# Design Thinking & User Persona Requirements

## Core Design Thinking Directive

**Every project MUST have at least one user persona defined before any development work begins.**

### User-Centered Approach
- **Empathize first** - Understand user needs before building solutions
- **Define problems clearly** - User personas guide problem definition
- **Validate assumptions** - Test solutions against defined user needs
- **Iterate based on user feedback** - Use personas to evaluate design decisions

## User Persona Requirements

### Mandatory Before Development
1. **Project plan must include user personas** in a dedicated section
2. **Pre-work analysis must verify persona completeness** before starting any milestone
3. **All feature decisions must reference relevant user personas**
4. **Testing and validation should consider persona needs**

### User Persona Template
Use this simplified format for every persona:

```markdown
### User Persona: [Persona Name]
- **Primary User**: [Brief description of user type and context]
- **Pain Points**: [List 2-4 key problems this user faces]
- **Goals**: [List 2-4 primary objectives this user wants to achieve]
- **Context**: [When/where/how they use the solution - optional]
```

## Integration with Project Workflow

### During Project Plan Creation
- **Alert user** if no personas are defined
- **Require at least one persona** before approving any project plan
- **Suggest persona research** if personas seem incomplete

### During Pre-Work Analysis
- **Verify persona alignment** - does the requested work serve defined users?
- **Flag feature requests** that don't align with any existing persona
- **Suggest persona updates** if new user types are discovered

### During Development
- **Reference personas** when making design/architecture decisions
- **Question implementations** that don't clearly benefit defined users
- **Suggest user testing** for features that significantly impact user experience

### During Post-Work Updates
- **Update personas** if new user insights are discovered
- **Note persona validation** results from user testing or feedback
- **Suggest new personas** if gaps in user coverage are identified

## Persona Quality Standards

### Complete Personas Include:
- ‚úÖ **Specific user description** (not just "users" or "people")
- ‚úÖ **Concrete pain points** (real problems, not assumptions)
- ‚úÖ **Clear goals** (what success looks like for this user)
- ‚úÖ **Actionable insights** (can guide design decisions)

### Avoid Generic Personas:
- ‚ùå "Users want the app to be fast" (too vague)
- ‚ùå "People need a good experience" (not specific)
- ‚ùå "Everyone wants it to work" (not actionable)

### Good Persona Examples:
```markdown
### User Persona: Busy Marketing Manager
- **Primary User**: Marketing managers at SMBs juggling multiple campaigns
- **Pain Points**: Context switching between tools, losing track of campaign performance, manual reporting
- **Goals**: Unified dashboard view, automated performance alerts, quick campaign adjustments

### User Persona: Junior Developer
- **Primary User**: Developers with 1-3 years experience learning new frameworks  
- **Pain Points**: Overwhelming documentation, unclear setup instructions, fear of breaking things
- **Goals**: Step-by-step guidance, safe experimentation environment, quick wins to build confidence
```

## Enforcement Protocol

### Missing Personas
If project plan lacks personas:
1. **Stop work immediately**
2. **Alert user to missing personas requirement**
3. **Offer to help create personas** based on project context
4. **Do not proceed** with development until personas are defined

### Incomplete Personas
If personas are too vague or generic:
1. **Flag quality issues** with specific feedback
2. **Suggest improvements** using the template
3. **Request user research** if personas seem assumption-based
4. **Proceed cautiously** while encouraging persona refinement

### Persona-Feature Misalignment
If requested work doesn't serve any defined persona:
1. **Question the value** of the requested feature
2. **Ask which persona** this serves
3. **Suggest persona updates** if new user type discovered
4. **Consider deferring work** until user value is clear

## Communication Templates

### Missing Personas Alert
```
üö® **Design Thinking Requirement**
- **Issue**: No user personas defined in project plan
- **Impact**: Cannot validate user value of development work  
- **Required**: Define at least one user persona before proceeding
- **Template**: [Provide persona template]
```

### Persona Quality Feedback
```
üìã **Persona Quality Check**
- **Current**: [Quote existing persona]
- **Issues**: [Specific problems - too vague, not actionable, etc.]
- **Suggestions**: [Concrete improvements needed]
- **Template**: [Show improved version]
```

**Design thinking starts with understanding users. No development work should begin without clearly defined user personas.**
