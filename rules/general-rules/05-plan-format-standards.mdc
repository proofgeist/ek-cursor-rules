# Project Plan Format Standards

## Required Plan Structure

Every project plan must include these sections:

```markdown
# Project Plan - [Project Name]

## Current Status
- **Phase**: [Current development phase]
- **Last Updated**: [Date]
- **Next Milestone**: [Target date and goals]
- **Overall Progress**: [X/Y milestones completed]

## Milestones
### [Milestone Name] - [Status] - [Target Date]
**Goal**: [Brief description of milestone objective]
**Progress**: [X/Y tasks completed] ([percentage]%)

- [ ] Task 1 - [Brief description]
- [x] Completed task - [Brief description]
- [🔄] In progress task - [Current status]
- [🚫] Blocked task - [Reason for block]
- [📝] New task discovered - [Why needed]

**Dependencies**: [List any dependencies]
**Risks**: [Known risks or concerns]

## Architecture Decisions
- **[Date]**: [Decision] - [Rationale and alternatives considered]

## Known Issues & Blockers
- **[Issue]**: [Description, impact, and resolution plan]

## Future Considerations
- [Items for later milestones or post-MVP]

## Change Log
- **[Date]**: [Summary of changes made to plan]
```

## Status Indicators

### Task Status
- `[ ]` **Planned**: Not yet started
- `[🔄]` **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- `[x]` **Completed**: Finished and verified
- `[🚫]` **Blocked**: Cannot proceed (include reason)
- `[📝]` **New**: Discovered during work
- `[⏸️]` **Paused**: Temporarily deprioritized
- `[🔍]` **Investigating**: Researching approach

### Milestone Status
- **🎯 Active**: Currently being worked on
- **✅ Complete**: All tasks finished
- **📋 Planned**: Scheduled for future
- **🚫 Blocked**: Cannot proceed
- **🔄 In Progress**: Some tasks completed

## Quality Standards

### Plan Maintenance
- Update **Last Updated** date with every change
- Remove completed items after milestone closure
- Keep future items realistic and well-defined
- Maintain clear, actionable task descriptions

### Consistency Requirements
- Task descriptions should be specific and measurable
- Dependencies must be clearly identified
- Blockers must include resolution plans
- Architecture decisions must include rationale

### Review Triggers
Update plan when:
- Starting new work
- Completing tasks
- Discovering new requirements
- Encountering blockers
- Making architecture decisions
- Changing priorities

**Maintain this format consistently to ensure the plan remains useful and actionable.**
