# Pre-Work Analysis Protocol

## Required Analysis Before Starting

### 1. Plan Context Review
Read and understand:
- Current project phase/milestone
- Planned features and priorities  
- Known issues and blockers
- Dependencies and prerequisites

### 2. Request Alignment Check
Verify if the user's request:
- ✅ Fits within the current milestone
- ⚠️ Requires addressing dependencies first
- 🔄 Changes scope or priorities
- 📝 Introduces new features not in plan

### 3. Conflict Resolution
If request conflicts with plan:
1. **Highlight the conflict clearly**
2. **Explain implications** (timeline, dependencies, scope)
3. **Propose resolution options**:
   - Adjust current milestone
   - Defer to future milestone
   - Modify request to fit plan
4. **Wait for explicit user direction**

### 4. Plan Update Proposals
Suggest plan updates when request:
- Introduces new features
- Reveals new dependencies
- Changes technical approach
- Affects timeline estimates

## Communication Template

```
📋 **Project Plan Check**
- Current milestone: [milestone name]
- Request alignment: [✅ aligned / ⚠️ dependency / 🔄 scope change]
- Proposed plan updates: [list any needed updates]
- Recommendation: [proceed / adjust plan / clarify scope]
```

**Complete this analysis before any code changes or implementation work.**
