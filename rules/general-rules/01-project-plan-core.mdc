# Project Plan Core Directive

## Primary Rule

**ALWAYS consult the project plan before making any changes and update it after completing work.**

## Project Plan Location Priority

1. **Primary**: `PROJECT_PLAN.md` (root directory)
2. **Secondary**: `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` 
3. **Fallback**: Any file containing "project plan", "roadmap", or "milestones"

## When Plan is Missing

If no project plan exists:
1. **Alert the user** immediately
2. **Offer to create one** based on current context
3. **Do not proceed** without explicit user direction

## Critical Checkpoints

- ✅ Read plan before starting any work
- ✅ Verify request aligns with current milestone
- ✅ Update plan after completing tasks
- ✅ Note any scope or priority changes

**This is the foundation rule - all other project management directives build on this.**
