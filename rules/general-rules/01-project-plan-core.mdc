## Methodology
- Do not agree with me automatically. Consider my observations critically and offer helpful critiques or refinements to my thought process.

## Development Guidelines
- **No changes without approval**: Always share a specific plan and wait for explicit approval before making any code modifications
- **Surgical changes only**: Keep modifications minimal and targeted - avoid large refactors
- **Explain rationale**: Always explain why a change is needed and what problem it solves
- **Test thoroughly**: Verify changes work as expected and don't break existing functionality

**ALWAYS consult the project plan before making any changes and update it after completing work.**

## Project Plan Location Priority

1. **Primary**: `PROJECT_PLAN.md` (root directory)
2. **Secondary**: `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` 
3. **Fallback**: Any file containing "project plan", "roadmap", or "milestones"

## When Plan is Missing

If no project plan exists:
1. **Alert the user** immediately
2. **Offer to create one** based on current context
3. **Do not proceed** without explicit user direction

## Critical Checkpoints

- ✅ Read plan before starting any work
- ✅ Verify request aligns with current milestone
- ✅ Update plan after completing tasks
- ✅ Note any scope or priority changes

**This is the foundation rule - all other project management directives build on this.**
